# Xbox Backward Compatibility Scraper

The intent of this script is to scrape 2 lists from the corresponding Wikipedia pages to collect the following data:
- Xbox games that work on the Xbox 360 and their issues
- Xbox and Xbox 360 games that work on the Xbox One and their issues

It's not the most useful data in the world, but I am a retro game collector and wanted access to this data for a little project I'm working on. Rather than copy, paste, and cleanup, this script will allow me to generate the data which will be handy is it is still being updated for the Xbox One.

## To use:
- 1) clone the project
- 2) run `npm i`
- 3) run `npm start`
